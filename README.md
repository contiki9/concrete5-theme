#concrete5 Theme Boilerplate#
A base to begin building your concrete5 theme.

**This package is for concrete 5.7.1+ (also the upcoming version 8) for a < 5.6.x version see [here](https://github.com/olsgreen/concrete5-theme-boilerplate/tree/1.0).**

Note that if you are not familiar with concrete, want to generate a packaged theme or just want to speed up development, you can fill in a form and [generate a customised theme boilerplate](https://c5labs.com/concrete5-boilerplate/concrete5-starter-theme) at c5labs.com. This will provide you with a customised theme or package zip that you can simply extract to your packages or theme directory without the need to update namespaces, handles, etc.
